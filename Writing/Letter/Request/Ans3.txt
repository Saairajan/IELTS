You saw an advertisement for a new fitness centre in your city and are interested in joining. Write a letter to the manager to inquire about membership options, facilities, and opening hours.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I recently saw an advertisement for your fitness centre, and I’m very interested in joining. I am looking for a good place to work out regularly, and your centre seems like a great option.

I would like to ask for some information about your membership plans. Could you please let me know what types of memberships you offer, and how much each one costs? Also, do the memberships include full access to all the facilities?

In addition, I would like to know more about the services at your gym. For example, what kind of workout equipment do you have? Do you offer group classes like yoga or aerobics? I’m also interested in personal training, so I’d appreciate it if you could tell me if that’s available.

Lastly, I’d like to ask about your opening hours on weekdays and weekends, as I need to make sure they fit my schedule.

Thank you for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Full Name]
