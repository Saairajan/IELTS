Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to ask for information about your evening courses. I recently saw that your college offers programs in areas like [Business Management / Digital Marketing / Software Development], and I am interested in joining one of them to improve my skills.

Could you please send me the timetable or class schedule for the upcoming term? I would like to know the days and times of the evening classes in my chosen subject so I can plan my time properly.

I would also like to know the total cost of the course. Please let me know the tuition fee, registration fee, or any extra costs like books or materials. If possible, could you also explain how I can make the payment, and whether there are any installment plans?

Finally, I would be thankful if you could explain the application process. I want to know what forms or documents I need to send and the deadline to apply.

Thank you very much for your help. I look forward to your reply.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Full Name]
