Dear Mr./Ms. [Landlord's Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a problem with the heating system in my new apartment, [Apartment Number], at [Address], which I moved into on [Date].

At first, the heating seemed to be working, but for the past two days, it has completely stopped. I tried changing the thermostat settings, but there is no heat at all. The apartment has become very cold, especially at night, and I am worried because the weather is getting colder.

I kindly request that you arrange for a technician to come and check the system as soon as possible. I am usually available after 5 PM on weekdays or anytime during the weekend, so please let me know when someone can visit.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope the issue can be fixed soon.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
