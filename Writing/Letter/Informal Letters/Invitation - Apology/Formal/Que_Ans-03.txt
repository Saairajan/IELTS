You made a mistake with a formal application and need to apologize. You also want to schedule a meeting to discuss the issue.

Dear Mr./Ms. [Recipient's Last Name],

I am writing to apologize for the incorrect information submitted in my application for the [mention the position, e.g., Senior Accountant] role. I realize that the dates for my previous employment were listed incorrectly, and I am very sorry for this oversight.

I understand the importance of accuracy in all documentation, and I take full responsibility for this mistake. I have since reviewed the application and corrected the dates in the attached revised document.

I would like to invite you to a brief meeting to discuss this matter in more detail and to ensure all information is now accurate. Please let me know what day and time would be most convenient for you in the coming week.

Thank you for your time and for your understanding.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
