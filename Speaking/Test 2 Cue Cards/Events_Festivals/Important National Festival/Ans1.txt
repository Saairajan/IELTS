Sinhala and Tamil New Year

"I want to talk about the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, which is a very important festival in my country, Sri Lanka.

We celebrate this festival on April 13th and 14th every year. It marks the end of the farming season and the start of the New Year for both Sinhala and Tamil people.

During this time, families go back to their homes to celebrate together. We clean our houses and cook special food like milk rice. We also do many old rituals at a special time. These rituals include lighting a lamp, eating the first meal together, and putting oil on our heads. People also give gifts and visit their relatives. I really enjoy playing traditional games like swinging and drumming in the evening.

What I like most is that it brings families together. Everyone tries to come home, no matter how busy they are. It’s a time to be with family and friends. My only problem is that the festival feels too short! It's only two days.

This festival is important because it is a time of unity and hope. It celebrates new beginnings and the strong connections between family and community. It’s a shared tradition for both the Sinhalese and Tamil people, which shows our country's unity and cultural harmony."
