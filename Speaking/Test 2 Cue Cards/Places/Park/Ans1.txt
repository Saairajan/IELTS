Alright, I’d like to talk about a park I really enjoy visiting. It’s called Viharamahadevi Park, and it’s in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka. This park is actually the biggest and oldest one in the city, and it’s right in front of the Colombo Town Hall, so it’s easy to find.

Even though I live in Digana, and sometimes stay in Arugam Bay, I try to visit this park whenever I come to Colombo for work or to see my family.

The park is very large and green, with big open lawns, tall trees that give a lot of shade, and many beautiful flowers. There’s also a big Buddha statue and a small pond where people can ride paddle boats. The walking paths are wide and clean, so it’s great for walking or jogging.

A lot of people go there for different things. Some bring their children to play in the playground, others go jogging or walking. Some people just sit on the grass, have a picnic, or relax with friends. Sometimes there are also art shows or small events. I often see students studying or couples spending time together.

I like this park because it’s very peaceful and relaxing. Even though it’s in the middle of a busy city, when I’m inside, I feel very calm. The trees, fresh air, and nature help me clear my mind. It’s a really nice break from the busy life outside.
