Alright, I'd like to talk about something I own that is really important to me – my personal journal. It’s basically a diary where I write down my thoughts and experiences.

I got it as a gift from my elder sister when I was about to start university, around five or six years ago. She told me it would be a nice way to record my journey and reflect on my life during that new stage. It’s just a simple notebook with a leather cover, but the gift felt very special to me.

Since then, I’ve kept it near my bed and write in it regularly. I use it to note down what happens in my day, my feelings, goals, and even random thoughts. I usually write in it a few times a week, especially when I feel stressed or need to clear my mind.

This journal means a lot to me for a few reasons. First, it helps me remember how I’ve grown over the years. When I read old entries, I can see how my thoughts have changed and how I’ve handled different situations. It’s like a personal time machine. Second, writing in it helps me deal with emotions and think more clearly. It’s very relaxing and gives me peace of mind. Lastly, it’s full of memories – every page reminds me of something I’ve been through. Even though it’s not expensive, the emotional value is huge, and I consider it priceless.
