Alright, I’d like to talk about a piece of technology that I use every single day – my smartphone. It’s just a simple model, not anything too advanced, but I always carry it with me.

I use it from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep. In the morning, it’s the first thing I check for messages or news, and at night, it’s the last thing I look at. So I’d say I use it throughout the whole day.

I use my phone for many things. First, it helps me talk to my family and friends, both in Digana and in other countries. I make calls, send messages, and use apps like WhatsApp. I also use it to check the news, scroll through social media, listen to music, and watch short videos. For daily tasks, I use it to set reminders, check emails, manage my calendar, and even do quick banking. When I travel to places like Arugam Bay, I also use it for maps and directions.

This smartphone helps me in many ways. It works like a personal assistant, a way to stay connected, and a source of entertainment. It saves me time and helps me stay organized. Most importantly, it keeps me in touch with people and helps me stay updated. In today’s fast-moving world, I think it’s a very useful and important tool in my life.
