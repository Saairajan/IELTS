"Alright, I’d like to talk about a non-fiction book I read recently called Atomic Habits by James Clear. I found it very useful and interesting.

The book is about how small changes in our daily habits can lead to big results over time. The writer explains four main rules to build good habits: make them clear, 
attractive, easy, and satisfying. He also says that it’s more important to build a good system than just to focus on big goals.

I read this book over two or three months. I usually read it in the evenings after work, 
or sometimes when I was travelling. I live in Arugam Bay, so I’d sit at home and read a few pages before going to bed.

One idea that really stood out to me was ‘getting 1% better every day’. 
It made me realize that small steps can still bring big improvements. I also learned about something called ‘habit stacking’, 
which means adding a new habit next to an old one. 
And I liked the part about ‘environment design’, which means changing your surroundings to make good habits easier and bad ones harder.

I enjoyed this book because the writer explained everything in a simple and clear way, with examples and stories. Also, it was very practical. 
After each chapter, I felt like I could try something new in my own life. It helped me think differently about habits and personal growth.
