Now I want to talk about a children’s story I read again recently. It’s called The Tortoise and the Hare. Even though it’s a simple story, I think the message is very powerful.

The story is about a race between a fast hare and a slow tortoise. The hare is proud and thinks he will win easily, so he takes a nap during the race. But the tortoise keeps going slowly and finally wins, because he doesn’t stop.

I read this story again when I was visiting my cousin. Her son had this storybook, and I sat down and read it with him one afternoon. It brought back memories from when I was a child.

What stood out to me this time was the message: “slow and steady wins the race.” I realized that in life, we don’t always need to rush. What matters more is being patient and staying focused on our goals.

I liked the story because it was short but meaningful. The language was simple, and the pictures helped explain the lesson. It reminded me to keep working towards my goals, even if I move slowly sometimes.
