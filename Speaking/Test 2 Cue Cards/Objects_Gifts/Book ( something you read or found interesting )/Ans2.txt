Alright, I’d like to talk about a book from the Bible that I read recently. It’s called the Book of Proverbs. I found it very meaningful and helpful in my life.

The Book of Proverbs is full of short, wise sayings. It teaches lessons about how to live a good life, make smart choices, and treat others with kindness and honesty. Most of the proverbs were written by King Solomon, who was known for his wisdom.

I started reading this book in the mornings after I woke up. I live in Arugam Bay, and it’s quiet in the mornings, so I liked to read a few verses with my tea. Sometimes I also wrote down the ones that touched me the most.

One proverb that really stayed with me was: “A gentle answer turns away anger, but a harsh word stirs up anger.” It helped me a lot in how I speak to others, especially when I feel upset. I also liked the ones that talked about discipline and patience, because they reminded me to stay calm and steady.

I enjoyed this book because it gave me advice I could use right away. Even though it’s very old, I felt like the words still speak to my daily life. It made me think more before I act, and it helped me grow in character.
